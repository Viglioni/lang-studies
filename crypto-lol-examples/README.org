** About
   - The purpose of this repo is to document some functions from [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lol-0.7.0.0/docs/Crypto-Lol-Types.html][Crypto.Lol]].
   - If you want to execute the codeblocks, you need to build before:
   #+begin_src shell :exports both 
     $ stack build
   #+end_src
   - The examples are located in ~/examples~.
