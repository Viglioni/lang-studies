* Paint fill
The goal of this problem is to implement a paint fill function, as in MS Paint fill tool.

*Input* :
- a matrix (of integers e.g.) representing a image, where each matrix cell represents a pixel.
- a position of a pixel to be clicked
- a new colour to fill from this pixel

*Output*: a new image filled from a pixel.

Example:
- image
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 |

- position (1,1)
- colour 2
- Output:
| 2 | 2 | 3 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 3 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
